# Neuro The Farmer Was Replaced Integration

This is an integration for the game [The Farmer Was Replaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?snr=5000_5100__), currently this is intended for someone else to play with Neuro to help her code.

## Running Dependencies

- This was developed with [BepinEx 5.4.23.4](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.4).
- You shouldn't have to download anything else.

## Building

After pulling from this repo, the only steps you should need are to get the project's dependencies and to set GamePath in NeuroTFWRIntegration to the game's folder. (The folder containing the exe file to run the game.)
Sorry if there is more you need to do, I'm a bit too lazy to set it up again to check if I'm right.

## Other stuff

As of right now this is considered finished, however updates and improvements will be made if needed. I may also add support for just Neuro gameplay if I ever feel like it.

This is mostly made in about 4 days so sorry for any edge cases or issues with the mod or the parser for the patch format.
